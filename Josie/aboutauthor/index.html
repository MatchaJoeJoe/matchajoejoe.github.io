							<h2 class="headline">Drew Filus - Author</h2>
							<p class="text-space">Drew Filus is the proud father of two, the lucky husband of one, a product of Coney Island, a graduate of Cornell, and an award-winning filmmaker. He lives in Los Angeles, talks his family into eating out too often, recycles everything and loves kicking back to watch TV after his kiddos are in bed. Drew writes for the big screen, the small screen, and the even smaller screens (smartphones and tablets). Sometimes he even gets to direct the things he writes. Under special circumstances, or if dared or tricked, Drew will eat an olive. Mr. Filus writes stories that he hopes mean something to people and finds it somewhat disconcerting to share all these things about himself. Upon reading one of the first stories for children Drew ever wrote, <em>A Fungus Among Us</em>, Drew’s wife (also a writer) said, “Y’know, this could be a series about a girl who goes on a bunch of science adventures.” And the Josie&#160;Robin, Science&#160;Fiend series was born.</p>

							<h2 class="headline">Megan Hutchison - Illustrator</h2>
							<p class="text-space">Megan always knew that she would have to be an artist in order to be happy in this world. This lead her to attend UCLA as a Design | Media Art Major where she was trained to graphically construct her creative ideas. Following her graduation, she attended the American Film Institute as a Production Design fellow. Her continued work in cinema allows her to explore narrative story telling, as well as create and build sets, props, costumes and other unworldly things, all of which are very artsy indeed. Her various work amalgamates into a happy balance of fine art, graphic design and narrative structure which manifests itself in her illustrative work. Recently she released her first young adult graphic novel with Archaia Comics An Aurora Grimeon Story: Will O' the Wisp. You can often find her creating custom illustrations for clients, showing pieces at various art shows around the Los Angeles area and at a drink and draw with her fellow comic book geeks</p>
