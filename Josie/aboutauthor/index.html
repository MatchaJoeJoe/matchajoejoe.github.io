					<img class="authorphoto" src="../images/drew.jpg">
					<p class="text-space">Drew Filus is the proud father of two, the lucky husband of one, a product
						of Coney Island, a graduate of Cornell, and an award-winning filmmaker.
						He lives in Los Angeles, talks his family into eating out too often, recycles
						everything and loves kicking back to watch TV after his kiddos are in bed.
						Drew writes for the big screen, the small screen, and the even smaller
						screens (smartphones and tablets). Sometimes he even gets to direct the
						things he writes. Under special circumstances, or if dared or tricked, Drew
						will eat an olive. Mr. Filus writes stories that he hopes mean something to
						people and finds it somewhat disconcerting to share all these things about
						himself. Upon reading one of the first stories for children Drew ever wrote,
						A FUNGUS AMONG US, Drew’s wife (also a writer) said, “Y’know, this
						could be a series about a girl who goes on a bunch of science adventures.”
						And the JOSIE ROBIN, SCIENCE FIEND series was born.
					<p class="authorname">MEGAN HUTCHISON</p>
					<img class="authorphoto" src="../images/megan.jpg">
					<p class="text-space">Megan always knew that she would have to be an artist in order to be
						happy in this world. This lead her to attend UCLA as a Design | Media Art
						Major where she was trained to graphically construct her creative ideas.
						Following her graduation, she attended the American Film Institute as a
						Production Design fellow. Her continued work in cinema allows her to
						explore narrative story telling, as well as create and build sets, props,
						costumes and other unworldly things, all of which are very artsy indeed.
						Her various work amalgamates into a happy balance of fine art, graphic
						design and narrative structure which manifests itself in her illustrative work.
						Recently she released her first young adult graphic novel with Archaia
						Comics An Aurora Grimeon Story: Will O' the Wisp. You can often find her
						creating custom illustrations for clients, showing pieces at various art
						shows around the Los Angeles area and at a drink and draw with her
						fellow comic book geeks.</p>
