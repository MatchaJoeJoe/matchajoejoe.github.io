				<p class="text">So I got this idea at <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013">TOC 2013</a>. It was inspired by the <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/26977">Git workshop</a> and the <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/27339">Medium Keynote</a>.</p>
				<p class="text">The idea is a pretty simple one. I wrote a story, turned it into a website, and now I want to make it better. The problem is, I personally do not have the time or resources to make better, at least not as good as it could be.</p>
				<p class="text">That's where you come in. I'm opening my book up to the public to see how good it can be.</p>
				<p class="text">I've posted the html code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/joefrizzell/joefrizzell.github.com/tree/master/raven-colors">here</a>.</p>
				<p class="text">Any suggestions are welcome. I will be making updates to the site as often as possible, hopefully at least once a week.</p>
				<p class="text">If you would like to see how the book is progressing, you can go <a href="http://joefrizzell.github.com/raven-colors">here</a>.</p>				
				<p class="text">Just to clarify, I don't plan on trying to make any money from this project, I just want to see what would happen if I put my idea out there and let it grow.</p>
