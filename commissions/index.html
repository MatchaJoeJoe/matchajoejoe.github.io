                <p class="text">If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.</p>
                <h3>1. GENERAL TERMS</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">All drawings will include a subtle signature that you may not remove.</li>
                  <li class="text">I might stream the drawing process on my twitch channel if I can/want to do so.</li>
                  <li class="text">Prices are subject to change based on demand.</li>
                  <li class="text">I have the right to reject any order for any reason.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. PAYMENT</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">All payments must be paid through Ko-fi or PayPal.</li>
                  <li class="text">Commissions through PayPal can be paid either 100% upfront or split 50% upfront and 50% after sketch approval. Ko-fi commissions must be paid 100% upfront. </li>
                  <li class="text">Do NOT send me any payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">Once I have received your commission request and confirmed that I am willing to work on it, I will add it to my commission queue and send a confirmation email.</li>
                  <li class="text">I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds).</li>
                  <li class="text">While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!</li>
                  <li class="text">The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.</li>
                  <li class="text">During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.</li>
                  <li class="text">The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 3 months depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, and other unknown factors.</li>
                  <li class="text">If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</li>
                  <li class="text">Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. Note that there is no physical product. Depending on where you live, we can arrange to print your artwork. Just ask :)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. REVISIONS</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless, of course, a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</li>
                  <li class="text">If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is usually based on an hourly wage.</li>
                  <li class="text">If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">I, the artist, claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text indent">Promote myself with it everywhere</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Post it wherever I want</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="text">The buyer is allowed to:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text indent">Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Use the artwork on in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="text">The following is considered copyright infringement:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text indent">Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Claiming the artwork as your own</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Removing my signature from the artwork</li>
                    <li class="text indent">Altering the artwork without my consent</li>
                    <li class="text indent">I reserve the full rights to the image and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!</li>
                  <li class="text">If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</li>
                  <li class="text">I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post the commissioned art anywhere, we can discuss this.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</li>
                  <li class="text">If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</li>
                  <li class="text">If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text">If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Nadia Axel (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.</p>
                <hr class="divider">
                <h3>What do you get?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text">Drafts/mockups that you must decide which one I should continue with (depending on the complexity of the commission there might be fewer or more drafts)</li>
                  <li class="text">Sketch and/or final sketches that you must accept before I continue the work</li>
                  <li class="text">Insight and involvement in color plan (depending on the complexity of the commissioned piece)</li>
                  <li class="text">Full-resolution file (varies based on commision type, see <a href="#comms">Commisions</a> section) of final drawing and a smaller version for internet upload. Final file formats are usually PNG.</li>
